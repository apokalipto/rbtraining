# TASK 1: 
# => 1) Write a method to determine if the argument input is a palindrome
# => 2) The input is case insensitive. The input may contain lowercase and uppercase letters. 
# 			The combination should not affect the result.
#  			Example: REDDER, RedDer and redder are palindromes.
module Task1

	def self.palindrome?(input)
		# YOUR CODE GOES HERE. Right now the method only returns false to fail the test.
		# You should change it. Run the test before chaning anything to see the result
	
		return false
	end
	
	def self.changed
		puts "Fuck"
